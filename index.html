          In the near future, I aspire to become a Developer. This ambition is
          driven by a passion for technology and a desire to create innovative
          solutions that can make a meaningful impact. As a developer, I aim to
          harness my skills in coding, problem-solving, and software design to
          build applications that are not only functional but also user-friendly
          and efficient.
